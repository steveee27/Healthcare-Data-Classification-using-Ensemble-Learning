# Healthcare-Data-Classification-using-Ensemble-Learning
This project uses a synthetic healthcare dataset to predict patient test results ("Normal," "Abnormal," or "Inconclusive") using machine learning. It employs ensemble methods such as Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, and Stacking classifiers with feature engineering and preprocessing.
